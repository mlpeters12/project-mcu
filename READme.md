*The Marvel Cinematic Universe*
===========

*The Marvel Cinematic Universe* is a fullstack web application designed to provide the user with information on Marvel movies, characters, and character relationships or affiliations. Integration of The Movie Database.org API provides all Marvel movies that have been released or are officially slated to be released in the future. Users can select a movie from a list of all Marvel movies available, read a description of that movie, and see all of the Marvel characters featured in that movie. The user can also navigate to a specific character's page which outlines that character's abilities, back story, the Marvel movies that character is featured in, and what team affiliations or relationships they are a part of. By selecting a specific affiliation or relationship, the user is directed to "Connections" where they can see a visual representation of how the characters are related to one another. *The Marvel Cinematic Universe* uses D3.js to dynamically display a model of specific connections between characters!

#### Version 2.0

###### Visually define connections in D3
I'd like to easily identify the type of relationship between characters to the user (ex: romantic, family, team relationships)

###### Solid Character API
In a future version, I would want to identify a reliable API that contains data on the movie version of the characters, not the comics version.

###### Timeline toggle on connections in D3
I would like to allow the user to determine the time in the MCU to show how certain connections change throughout the development of the movies. 

#### Favorite Challenges
Once I was able to get the D3.js to render on the page, I was met with the task of creating a visualization that could be easily understand by a user. This allowed be to dive back into my data visualization skills and determine how the visualization should be rendered. Just because you can display something, doesn't mean that you should.
